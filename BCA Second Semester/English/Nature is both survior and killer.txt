Jack Williamson's *The Metamorphosite* short story has well captured the dual nature of nature as a survivor and killer, through the central conflict and themes that develop in the story. The narrative revolves around the interactions of humans and aliens with this shape-shifting creature known as the Metamorphosite. This is an organism that narratively embodies the dualism of survival and destruction that defines nature. 

### Nature Survivior
The Metamorphosite is representative of the survival drive and adaptation of nature. Its ability to mimic and transform itself into other living forms underlies the resilience and resourcefulness innate in nature. Thus, adaptation gives it the right to endure and to prosper in environments that are hostile towards it-a continuity of life: evolving to overcome obstacles and surviving. The transformations of the Metamorphosite in this story indicate that, just as many species do evolve mechanisms to prevent themselves from going extinct, so too does this Metamorphosite.

### Nature as A Killer
At the same time, it declares the Metamorphosite as a killer: ruthless and frequently violent. The death is also part of the third of the transformation, parasitic, when the metamorphosite transforms humans into alien hosts to parasites or infects them with its germ. This emphasizes how survival in nature usually comes at the expense of others, and it reflects the predator-prey relationship in the natural world, where one organism dies for another to live: in this primitive story, Jack Williamson indeed presents nature in its brutal aspect, wherein survival comes to mean destruction.

### Justification of the Statement
This gives, therefore, justification to the statement "nature is both survivor and killer" by show that these two aspects are not contradictory, but rather intertwined. The Metamorphosite's survival relies on maintaining an adaptable and persistent interface (survivor), necessarily predation assimilation for its survival.
